                                              Task1:-
Let's assume that Destination's IP is 192.168.20.55 (Linux box that you want to access)
We want to access from Linux client with IP 138.47.99.99.
SSH from the destination to the source (with public IP):-ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 sourceuser@138.47.99.99(* port 19999 can be any unused port)
Now we can SSH from source to destination through SSH tunneling:ssh localhost -p 19999

                                               Task2:-
scp -r wk1 userVM@localhost:path
//where path is where the wk1 will be copied
#!/bin/bash
scp -r folder1 host2@localhost:/home/wk-1

                                               Task3:-
sudo apt-get install openssh-client:-Install an OpenSSH Client
sudo apt-get install openssh-server ii:-to install the OpenSSH server
sudo service ssh status:-SSH service is now running properly
ssh localhost:-to test if the OpenSSH server is installed properly and will accept connections
Enter yes or y to continue:-to  set up your server to accept SSH connection requests from a different
computer using an SSH client.
Now edit the SSH daemon configuration file(can change the default port for SSH connections)run this command to open configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
To restart SSH service every time you make any changes to the sshd_config file by running this command: sudo service ssh restart
To establish a secure remote connection with your servers:-ssh your_username@host_ip_address 'COMMAND'

                                               Task4:-
sftp username@ip_address
                                               Task5:-
To view the proxy environment variables:-env | grep proxy
wget “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)":-Wget is a computer program that retrieves content from web servers supports downloading via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP
IF Proxy tunneling failed: Proxy Authentication Required ,we have to modify the proxy environment variables to include username and password using export.Note : export is a Linux command used to set and modify environment variables.
export https_proxy=http://<user>:<pass>@<proxy>:<port>/
Then, try the wget again. This time, it will work.
